description: |
  C.MOP.9 is encoded in the reserved encoding space corresponding to C.LUI x9, 0.
  Unlike the MOPs defined in the Zimop extension, the C.MOP.n instructions are defined to not
  write any register. Their encoding allows future extensions to define them to read register x[9].

  This is c.mop.9 from the compressed MOP instruction family.
