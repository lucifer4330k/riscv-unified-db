description: |
  The Zimop extension defines 8 MOP instructions named MOP.RR.n, where n is an integer between 0
  and 7, inclusive. Unless redefined by another extension, this instruction simply writes 0 to X[xd].
  Its encoding allows future extensions to define it to read X[xs1] and X[xs2], as well as write X[xd].

  This is mop.rr.5 from the MOP.RR instruction family (n=5).
